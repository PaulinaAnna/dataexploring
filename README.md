Project for Course Introduction to Data and SQL. Main goal was to create database with at leat 5 tables and use all the requirend queries on choosen datasets.  As the world is going to be 8 billion people in Nov 2022 and I wote analysis on 7 bln people in 2011 I was curious about how the world is changing. I spend around 70% of my time on solving issues with data - for example MySQL give you null tables as result of Join query if you have some words as your column names - as "code" "name", and funtion - and  you need to find out why code does not work because technically it's not a mistake. And "alter table" does not work as well.
In my analysis I am focusing on fertility rate - and differences between different country groups.
